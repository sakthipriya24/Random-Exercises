/* Problem Statement – Mr. Robot is making a website, in which there is a tab to create a password. As other websites, there are rules so that the password gets complex and none can predict the password for another. So he gave some rules like:

At least one numeric digit
At Least one Small/Lowercase Letter
At Least one Capital/Uppercase Letter
Must not have space 
Must not have slash (/)
At least 6 characters
If someone inputs an invalid password, the code prints: “Invalid password, try again”.

Otherwise, it prints: “password valid”.

Input Format:

A line with a given string as a password

Output Format:

If someone inputs an invalid password, the code prints: “Invalid password, try again”.
Otherwise, it prints: “password valid”, without the quotation marks.
Constraints:

Number of character in the given string <=10^9
Sample input 1: 

abjnlL09

Sample output 1: 

password valid

Sample input 2: 

jjnaskpk

Sample output 2: 

Invalid password, try again */

Solution:

digits=[]
lower=[]
upper=[]
print ("Enter a Password: ")
pwd = input()
if len(pwd)>0:
    for i in pwd:
        if i.isdigit():
            digits.append(i)
        elif i.islower():
            lower.append(i)
        elif i.isupper():
            upper.append(i)
        else:
            if i.isspace():
                print ("Invalid Password: Password must not have space!!")
            elif i=='/':
                print ("Invalid Password: Password must not have slash!!")
            else:
                continue
    if len(digits)<1:
        print ("Invalid Password: Password should have atleast one numeric digit!!")
    elif len(lower)<1:
        print ("Invalid Password: Password should have atleast one Small/Lowercase Letter!!")
    elif len(upper)<1:
        print ("Invalid Password: Password should have atleast one Capital/Uppercase Letter!!")
    elif len(lower)+len(upper)<6:
        print ("Password should contain atleast 6 characters")
    else:
        print ("Valid Password!!")
else:
    print ("Password cannot be null!!")
