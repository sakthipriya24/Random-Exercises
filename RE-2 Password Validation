/* Problem Statement – Mr. Robot is making a website, in which there is a tab to create a password. As other websites, there are rules so that the password gets complex and none can predict the password for another. So he gave some rules like:

At least one numeric digit
At Least one Small/Lowercase Letter
At Least one Capital/Uppercase Letter
Must not have space 
Must not have slash (/)
At least 6 characters
If someone inputs an invalid password, the code prints: “Invalid password, try again”.

Otherwise, it prints: “password valid”.

Input Format:

A line with a given string as a password

Output Format:

If someone inputs an invalid password, the code prints: “Invalid password, try again”.
Otherwise, it prints: “password valid”, without the quotation marks.
Constraints:

Number of character in the given string <=10^9
Sample input 1: 

abjnlL09

Sample output 1: 

password valid

Sample input 2: 

jjnaskpk

Sample output 2: 

Invalid password, try again */
