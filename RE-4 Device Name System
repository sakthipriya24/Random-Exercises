/* Problem Statement – Rocky is a software engineer and he is creating his own operating system called “myFirst os”. myFirst os  is a GUI (Graphical user interface) 
based operating system where everything is stored in files and folders. He is facing issues on  creating unique folder names for the operating system . 
Help rocky to create the unique folder name for it’s os.If folder name already exists in the system and integer number is added at the name to make it unique. 
The integer added starts with 1 and is incremented by 1 for each new request of an existing folder name. 
Given a list of folder names , process all requests and return an array of corresponding folder names.
Example  :
n=5
foldername= [‘home’ , ‘myfirst’ ,’downloads’, ‘myfirst’, ‘myfirst’]
foldername[0]= ‘home’ is unique.
foldername[1]= ‘myfirst’ is unique.
foldername [2]=’downloads’ is unique.
foldername[3]=’myfirst’ already exists in our system. So Add1 at the end of the folder name i.e foldername[3]=”myfirst1″
foldername[4]=’myfirst’ also already exists in our system.So add 2 at the end of the folder name i.e. foldername[4]=”myfirst2″.
folderNameSystem function has the following parameters
string foldername[n]: an array of folder name string in the order requested
Returns:
String[n]:  an array of strings usernames in the order assigned
Constraints :
    1<=n<=10^4
    1<=length of foldername[i]<20
    foldername[i] contains only lowercase english letter in the range ascii[a-z]
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer n , denoting the size of the array usernames
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where i<=0<=n) contains a string usernames[i] representing a username request in the order received.
Sample case :
4
home 
download
first
first
Sample Output :
home
download
first
first1
Explanation :
   foldername[0] = ‘home’ is unique
   foldername[1]=’download’ is unique
   foldername[2]= ‘first’ is unique
   foldername[3]=’first’ is already existing . so add 1 to it and it become first1
